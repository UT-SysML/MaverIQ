We live in London and are currently paying 2200£, they're expecting us to pay 2400£ now. When we moved in we were told the rent increase would be between 3 and 5%, but that hasn't been the case. We were also told that upon renewal we would be able to sign a lease for 2 years, which now apparently is not possible either. Now we feel we cannot trust what we're told, as it seems the conditions can change without notice.

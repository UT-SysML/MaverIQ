We know our signal is band-limited because we filtered it with an ideal brick-wall filter with a pass-band equal to the band-width of the signal; thus the signal is strictly band-limited. Using LaTeX to beautify your mathematical expressions, what is the spectrum of the sampled signal from a purely mathematical point of view? I'm not interested in practical or real scenarios

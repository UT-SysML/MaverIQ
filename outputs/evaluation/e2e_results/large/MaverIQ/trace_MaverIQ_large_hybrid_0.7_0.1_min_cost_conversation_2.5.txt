Contentful only allows me to have 5 users before it starts charging $400 a month. How can I redevelop the architecture of the library web app around using Vue? The app needs to have a music player, ability to upload beats, auto calculate the bpm, auto calculate the song key, use AI to tag the beat with specific vibes, and use AI to take those tags to generate a track name. How can I rebuild this?

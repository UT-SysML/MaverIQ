Using LaTeX to beautify your mathematical expressions, what is the spectrum of the sampled signal from a purely mathematical point of view? I'm not interested in practical or real scenarios

But a lot of times you see people gaining weight back. Does the body produce new fat cells?  When you lose weight naturally through a change of diet and/or exercise, do fat cells shrink or do they disappear? So say a 300 lb person reached 180lb and was steady at that weight for a year. Would the fat cells disappear, or are they still there but "deflated" as there is less overall fat in the body?
